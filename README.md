This project aims to make an mobile application that can be used for taking advice on how to dress according to weather and the personal wardrobe.  Main idea of this project is to be able to get some suggestions from this application with the help of the weather and the wardrobe of the user, which we expect user the add his or her clothes to the application with the color and the type of clothes also with a photograph, then the application will use the wheather data to give an idea on how to dress as which can be simply explained as helping to make an clothing combination with regards to weather at users location or the users destination. With this application we are looking to help people about preparing their clothes without having to think too much about it also with this mobile application they will be able to prepare for a vacation or a kind of activity which requires to be away from the main wardrobe for some time by planning their clothing beforehand with the information regarding to weather of the destination so that their preperation for that activity will be much easier than taking some clothes with them then trying to match them at the destination for the duration of the trip.

This project will be using flutter, dart as the main programming language as they give flexibility to make an application for both Android and IOS.

As some technical details are not yet concrete we have decided to add them later during the project as they are finalized get ready to be used.
